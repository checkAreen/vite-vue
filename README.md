** Vite + VueJS 3 (Composition API) **

Finally, I've built my first SPA on Vue. This is my first experience of using JS frameworks.
In this project I've been using Vite, Vue 3 (Composition API), Vue Router, Pinia and Bootstrap with SCSS.

Yes, it's not an excellent project, but I've spent a lot of time to understand patterns of building on Vue and finally it works and seems fine.
